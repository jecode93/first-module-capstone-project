# Module 1 First Capstone project description

> I recently completed my first capstone project, which involved building a functional web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I worked with these programming languages to design and develop the various elements of the application, including the user interface, the dynamic section, and the interactive features.

> I was excited to learn how to create a mobile menu with a hamburger icon and a dynamic part of the website using Javascript. This was a new skill for me, and I was happy to be able to apply it to my project.

> The final product is a fully functional web application that is both user-friendly and visually appealing. I am proud of the final product and excited to continue building upon my knowledge of these programming languages for future projects.
